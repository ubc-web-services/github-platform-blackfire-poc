#UBC CLF 7.0.4 DRUPAL THEME FEATURES
_________________

This package includes both a base and child theme. The base theme, *galactus* is not intended to be used as the site theme. Instead, use *clf* as your theme and make any overrides, changes and additions there. This will allow for easier updates should they become necessary.

#IE8 Support
_________________
Drupal 8 does not support Internet Explorer versions earlier than version 9 due to using jQuery version 2.x. Support for this  may be investigated further, but for the time being, this limitation also holds true for this theme. If IE8 support is required, Drupal 7 should be used instead with the CLF base theme (Megatron).
